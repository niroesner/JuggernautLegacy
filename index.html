The futuristic megacity The Lab is the residence of millions of living souls. It’s inhabitants can easily be divided into two lifestyles. Witches and Gunslingers. In the Centre District the most popular coven is the Golden Circle and the most famous gang are The Ruby Riders.
Both those fractions mostly rummage through the ruins of the old ones, looking for valuable Shards, relicts from the old ones. But what both groups want to possess more than anything else is the mysterious Juggernaut. A certain rivalry is predetermined. <br>
        <br>    
The game consists of two fractions that try to succeed each other. This is done by gathering Personal Points (PP) which are summed up to the total of all Team points (TP). The team with the most TP at the end of a fixed term winns. PP are gathered doing interactions or by the possession of so called “cards”. Cards either generate new PP or destroy PP of the player who possesses the card. Cards can be stolen or passed on in battles. Players earn in-game money by every interaction the make. With the money players can buy items which benefit their play. Certain actions can only be accomplished at certain locations.
